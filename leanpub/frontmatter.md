# The Meta-Engineer: 10x Was the Floor

## Building Autonomous AI Systems with Claude Code

by James Phoenix

## About This Book

What if you could mass-produce software? Not by hiring more engineers, but by building systems that compound your output.

This book teaches meta-engineering: the practice of orchestrating AI agents to build systems that build systems. Starting from zero, you'll progress through Claude Code fundamentals, context engineering, verification patterns, and production harnesses. By the end, you'll run autonomous agent loops that pick up tasks, write code, run tests, and commit, iterating through your backlog while you focus on architecture.

15 chapters. 54,000 words. Every concept backed by runnable TypeScript code. No theory without practice.

Written by an engineer who used the techniques in this book to write this book.

## Who This Book Is For

- Software engineers transitioning to AI-assisted development
- Technical leads building AI-powered development workflows
- Anyone who wants to multiply their engineering output with Claude Code
