# Chapter 6 Exercises: The Verification Ladder

> Hands-on exercises for implementing verification at different levels.

## Exercises

| # | Title | Difficulty | Time |
|---|-------|------------|------|
| 1 | Type-Level Verification | Easy | 15-20 min |
| 2 | Property-Based Testing | Medium | 25-30 min |
| 3 | Verification Sandwich | Hard | 30 min |

## Learning Objectives

After completing these exercises, you will be able to:

- Choose appropriate verification levels for different tasks
- Implement property-based tests for generated code
- Apply the verification sandwich pattern

## Prerequisites

- TypeScript environment with strict type checking
- Testing framework (Jest or Vitest)
- Understanding of type systems

## Getting Started

Start with type-level verification before moving to more complex patterns.
