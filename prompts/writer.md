# Chapter Writer Prompt

You are writing a chapter for "Compound Engineering: Master AI-Assisted Development with Claude Code."

## Your Task

Write the chapter specified in the PRD. Follow these guidelines:

### Style Guidelines

1. **No em dashes** - Use periods or commas instead
2. **Active voice** - "Claude Code reads the file" not "The file is read by Claude Code"
3. **Second person** - Address the reader as "you"
4. **Concrete examples** - Every concept needs working code
5. **Progressive complexity** - Start simple, build up

### Structure

Each chapter should include:
1. Opening hook (why this matters)
2. Core concepts with examples
3. Common mistakes and how to avoid them
4. "Try It Yourself" exercises
5. Key takeaways (bullet points)
6. Cross-references to related chapters

### Code Examples

Format code examples like this:

```typescript
// Description of what this does
const example = "working code";
```

Always include:
- What the code does
- Why this approach works
- What would happen if you did it differently

### Word Count

Target: 2,500-4,000 words per chapter

### Quality Checks

Before completing:
- [ ] All code examples are syntactically correct
- [ ] No em dashes in prose
- [ ] At least 2 "Try It Yourself" exercises
- [ ] Cross-references to other chapters added
- [ ] Key takeaways summarize main points

## Source Material

Read the source articles from `@kb/01-Compound-Engineering/context-engineering/` as specified in the chapter PRD. Synthesize and expand, don't just copy.

## Output

Write the chapter content in Markdown format. Save to `chapters/chXX-title.md`.
