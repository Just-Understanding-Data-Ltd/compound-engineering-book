| PRDs | 15 | 15 | 100% |
| Chapter Drafts | 7 | 15 | 47% |
| Word Count | 18,651 | 53,000-72,000 | 26-35% |

## Quality Dashboard

| Check | Issues | Severity Breakdown | Trend |
|-------|--------|-------------------|-------|
| AI Slop | 48 | 1 critical, 45 high, 2 medium | stable |
| Tech Accuracy | 18 | 8 errors, 10 warnings | new |
| Term Intros | 38 | 12 high priority | new |
| Cross-refs | 16 | 9 critical, 7 medium | new |
| O'Reilly Style | 89 | 23 high, 41 medium, 25 low | new |

**Quality Notes:**
- Chapters are remarkably clean for AI slop (most issues in PRDs)
- Chapter 2 has CLI syntax errors that need systematic fixing
- 63+ heading case issues across all chapters (C-level headings use Title Case instead of sentence case)

---

## Top 5 Priority Actions

1. **Write remaining chapter drafts (ch08-ch15)** - 8 chapters remaining, blocking all downstream work

2. **Fix Chapter 2 CLI syntax errors** - `claude ask` and `claude chat` commands don't exist; needs systematic replacement with `claude -p` and `claude`

3. **Fix PRD-to-chapter numbering alignment** - 5 PRDs have outdated numbers after TOC restructure; 4 new PRDs need creation for ch03, ch08, ch12, ch15

4. **Add term introductions in chapters 1-4** - CRUD, CI/CD, DDD, OTEL, LLM acronyms need expansion on first use

5. **Convert C-level headings to sentence case** - 63+ instances across all chapters need batch fix for O'Reilly compliance

## Recommendations

### Immediate (This Session)
1. Write Chapter 8: Error Handling & Debugging first draft
2. After ch08, proceed sequentially through ch09-ch15

### Short-Term (Next 2-3 Sessions)
1. Complete ch08-ch10 drafts (Error Handling, Context Engineering, RALPH Loop)
2. Begin systematic review fixes in ch01-ch07

### Medium-Term (Week 2)
1. Complete all chapter drafts (ch11-ch15)
2. Create high-priority diagrams for ch01-ch07
3. Run code validation on all chapters

### Quality Debt to Address
1. Ch02 CLI syntax: ~15 instances of wrong commands
2. Heading case: 63+ headings need sentence case
3. Term introductions: 38 undefined terms/acronyms
4. Cross-references: 9 broken links to fix after all chapters exist
