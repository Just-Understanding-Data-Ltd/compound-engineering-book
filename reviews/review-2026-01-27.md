## Review Agent Findings

### 1. Slop Checker (AI Text Detection)

**Overall: EXCELLENT** - All 15 chapters clean of AI tells.

| Category | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Em dashes in chapters | 0 | PASS |
| Blacklisted words (delve, crucial, pivotal, robust) | 0 | PASS |
| Blacklisted phrases (Additionally, Furthermore, Moreover) | 0 | PASS |
| "Paradigm" phrases | 2 | ch14:316, prds/ch11:65 |
| Em dashes in PRDs | 39 | Critical - violates style guide |

**Files with em dashes (39 total)**:
- prds/ch01.md (1)
- prds/ch02.md (1)
- prds/ch04.md (5)
- prds/ch06.md (5)
- prds/ch07.md (1)
- prds/ch09.md (3)
- prds/ch10.md (3)
- prds/ch11.md (11)
- prds/ch12.md (8)

**Key Finding**: Chapters are publication-ready. PRD em dashes need bulk find-replace before any conversion.

### 2. Tech Accuracy (Code & CLI Validation)

**Overall: GOOD** - 18 issues, mostly verification items.

#### Critical Errors (5)

| Location | Issue | Fix |
|----------|-------|-----|
| Multiple chapters | Model ID `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` format inconsistency | Verify against Anthropic docs |
| ch13 | MCP SDK import path `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/index.js` | Verify actual path |
| ch02 | Claude Code installation command | Verify package name |
| ch15 | API pricing will become stale | Add "as of publication date" disclaimer |
| ch07 | Cross-reference `ch06-verification-ladder.md` | Correct to `ch06-the-verification-ladder.md` |

#### Warnings (8)

- Stripe API currency format (uppercase vs lowercase)
- Tool naming consistency across chapters
- TypeScript strict mode claims without tsconfig shown
- File path conventions mixed
- Environment variable null checks missing
- Git command safety warnings needed
- Docker/compose completeness
- Test framework naming inconsistency

#### Low Priority (5)

- Skip-validation comments (internal tooling)
- Placeholder values documentation
- Import statement completeness
- CLI flag documentation
- Version specificity

**Key Finding**: No fundamental conceptual errors. Issues are formatting/consistency items.
