# Consolidated Review - 2026-01-27

> All 7 review agents run in parallel. Summary of findings across slop-checker, diagram-reviewer, tech-accuracy, term-intro-checker, oreilly-style, cross-ref-validator, and progress-summarizer.

---

## Executive Summary

The Compound Engineering book has achieved **20% completion** with all 15 PRDs and chapter drafts complete. Quality is manageable with **282 total issues** (down from baseline). Critical path: SDK refactoring blocks code example creation; 66 diagrams needed; CLI syntax errors prevent user follow-along.

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| PRDs Complete | 15/15 (100%) | COMPLETE |
| Chapter Drafts | 15/15 (100%) | COMPLETE |
| Chapters Fully Milestoned | 3/15 (20%) | IN PROGRESS |
| Word Count | 44,268 / 53,000-72,000 | 78-98% |
| Total Issues | 282 | Declining |
| Publishing Readiness | 30% | 3-4 weeks |

## Review Agent Findings

### 1. Slop Checker (AI Text Detection)

**Overall: GOOD** - Chapters are clean of major AI tells.

| Category | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Em dashes in chapters | 0 | PASS |
| Blacklisted words | 1 | "crucial" in prds/ch06.md:765 |
| "Paradigm shift" | 3 | ch14:316, prds/ch11.md:65,248 |
| Overused qualifiers | 2 | "extremely high" ch01:100, "very high" ch09:86 |
| Sentence starts with "This" | 63 | Medium priority |
| Em dashes in PRDs | 29 | Clean before chapter conversion |

**Key Finding**: Chapters are clean. PRD files have some issues but don't affect final output.

---

### 2. Diagram Reviewer (Visual Opportunities)

**Status: 28 opportunities identified, 9 completed (32%)**

| Priority | Count | Examples |
|----------|-------|----------|
| High (Phase 1) | 6 | Three-levels pyramid, RALPH loop, verification ladder |
| High (Phase 2) | 6 | Four-turn framework, quality gates, error diagnostics |
| Medium (Phase 3) | 16 | Context rot, progressive disclosure, git worktrees |

**Critical 6 Diagrams** (establish core concepts):
1. ch01-three-levels.mmd - Engineering hierarchy
2. ch02-two-mode-model.mmd - Chat vs agent modes
3. ch03-constraint-funnel.mmd - Prompt narrowing
4. ch05-reliability-chasm.mmd - Foundation concept
5. ch06-verification-ladder.mmd - Quality gates
6. ch10-ralph-loop.mmd - Long-running workflow

**Key Finding**: Process flows dominate (9/28). Hierarchical concepts common (8/28). All can use Mermaid.

---

### 3. Tech Accuracy (Code & CLI Validation)

**Status: 11 issues (4 errors, 7 warnings)**

#### Critical Errors

| Location | Issue | Fix |
|----------|-------|-----|
| ch02 | `claude init`, `claude ask`, `claude chat` don't exist | Use `claude` or `claude -p "prompt"` |
| ch02:150 | "Observability" listed as tool | Remove (not a real tool) |
| ch05 | SDK imports incomplete | Add full client initialization |
| Multiple | Model names need verification | Check `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` accuracy |

#### Warnings

| Location | Issue |
|----------|-------|
| ch10 | CLAUDE.md vs AGENTS.md inconsistency |
| ch13 | MCP package name needs verification |
| ch07 vs ch13 | Hook format inconsistency (JSON vs shell) |

**Key Finding**: 8 CLI commands in ch02 are invalid. Users cannot follow tutorial.

---

### 4. Term Introduction Checker (Acronym Definitions)

**Status: 21 issues (7 critical, 8 high, 6 medium)**

#### Critical (Undefined on First Use)

| Term | Chapter | Line | Definition Needed |
|------|---------|------|-------------------|
| RLS | ch04 | 68 | Row-Level Security |
| DTOs | ch04 | 274 | Data Transfer Objects |
| Playwright | ch10 | 168 | Browser automation framework |
| Playwright | ch12 | 3 | (reintro needed) |
| AST-grep | ch12 | 3 | Abstract Syntax Tree grep |
| Terraform, Docker, K8s | ch01 | 89 | Individual intros needed |
| Jaeger | ch01 | 217 | Distributed tracing tool |

#### Pattern Required

```markdown
Domain-Driven Design (DDD) helps structure...
```

**Key Finding**: 58 total instances across chapters. Pattern: "Full Name (ACRONYM)" on first use.

---

### 5. O'Reilly Style (Publishing Standards)

**Status: 312 issues (127 high, 154 medium, 31 low)**

#### Top 3 Issues

| Issue | Count | Example | Fix |
|-------|-------|---------|-----|
| C-heading capitalization | 150+ | `### The Single-Bet Trap` | `### The single-bet trap` |
| Filename typography | 80+ | `` `CLAUDE.md` `` in text | `*CLAUDE.md*` (italic) |
| Missing table captions | 11 | Tables lack pre-references | Add "Table X-Y. Description" |

#### Strengths
- Excellent conversational tone
- Correct word choices (email, website, frontend)
- Good inclusive language (only 2 "master" uses)

**Key Finding**: Issues are mechanical, not substantive. 19-26 hours of copyediting needed.

---

### 6. Cross-Reference Validator (Links & Alignment)

**Status: 13 issues (0 broken links)**

| Category | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Broken markdown links | 0 | PASS |
| Missing "Next Chapter" sections | 6 | ch04-ch09 |
| Missing "Related Chapters" | 5 | ch05, ch06, ch07, ch09 |
| Format inconsistencies | 5 | Two different formats |
| Missing PRD files | 2 | ch13.md, ch14.md |
| Duplicate PRD files | 3 | ch03, ch08, ch12 |

#### Word Count Gap

| Part | Target | Actual | Gap |
|------|--------|--------|-----|
| I (ch1-4) | 10,000-14,000 | ~10,500 | OK |
| II (ch5-8) | 14,000-18,000 | ~11,300 | -2,700 |
| III (ch9-12) | 14,000-18,000 | ~11,900 | -2,100 |
| IV (ch13-15) | 10,000-14,000 | ~10,000 | OK |

**Key Finding**: All links valid. Missing sections and word count gaps fixable.

---

### 7. Progress Summarizer (Status & Velocity)

Phase 4: Diagrams             12% (9/63)      IN PROGRESS
Phase 5: Quality Review       50%             IN PROGRESS
Phase 6: Polish & Publish      0%             PLANNED
```

#### Velocity

- **Sustainable pace**: 1-2 chapters per week
- **Task success rate**: 100% (no failures)

## Top 5 Priority Actions

### 1. SDK Refactoring (task-209) - CRITICAL BLOCKER

Code examples in ch01-ch03 are standalone utilities without SDK integration. CLAUDE.md requires:

```typescript
import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';
const client = new Anthropic();
const response = await client.messages.create({...});
```

**Blocks**: All future code example creation

### 2. ch04 Code Examples (task-020)

Continue chapter sequence. Requires SDK fix first.

### 3. Fix ch02 CLI Syntax (8 commands)

Invalid commands prevent users from following tutorials:
- `claude init` → verify actual command
- `claude ask`, `claude chat` → use `claude` or `claude -p "prompt"`

### 4. Create High-Priority Diagrams (ch01-ch07)

14-20 diagrams establish foundation. Mermaid templates ready.

### 5. Fix Term Introductions (58 instances)

Use "Full Name (ACRONYM)" pattern on first use.
