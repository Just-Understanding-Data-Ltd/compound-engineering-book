**Status**: Code written (DONE) - 4 milestones remaining
**Effort**: 6-8 hours
**Sequence**: START IMMEDIATELY

**Subtasks**:
- **task-087** (code_tested): 1-2 hours
  - Run all tests (61 tests already written)
  - Verify TypeScript compiles with no errors
  - Run all demo scripts

- **task-088** (reviewed): 1-2 hours
  - AI slop check (should be clean)
  - Fix 7 high-priority term introductions
  - Add cross-references to ch13-14

- **task-089** (diagrams): 1-2 hours
  - Create 4 remaining diagrams:
    1. Model Selection Strategy (decision tree)
    2. Cost Escalation Ladder (progressive complexity)
    3. Provider Router Architecture (multi-cloud)
    4. Token Budget Visualization (allocation table)

- **task-090** (final): 0.5 hours
  - Verify all quality gates pass
  - Word count in range (2,500-4,000)
  - All diagrams present (5/5)
  - Cross-references complete

**Impact**: Completes 15/15 chapters (100%)
**Blocker**: None - all code exists and tests pass

### 2. HIGH: Fix Critical PRD Em Dashes (13 instances)
**Status**: Identified in 9 PRD files
**Effort**: 30 minutes (batch find-and-replace)
**Can do**: Parallel with ch15 work

**Files affected**:
- prds/ch01.md, ch02.md, ch04.md, ch06.md, ch07.md, ch09.md, ch10.md, ch11.md, ch12.md

**Pattern**: Replace "X—Y" with "X: Y" or "X. Y"
**Impact**: Eliminates all critical AI slop issues
**Timing**: Can be done last (before publication)

### 3. HIGH: Fix High-Priority Term Introductions (7 items)
**Status**: Identified with specific lines
**Effort**: 30-45 minutes
**Can do**: During ch15 review milestone

**Critical items**:
1. **MTok** (ch15:18) - "million tokens (MTok)"
2. **MCP** (ch13:439) - forward reference before definition at line 476
3. **API** (ch12:47) - never defined
4. **JWT** (ch12:43, ch10:16) - never defined
5. **REST** (ch11:96) - missing definition
6. **YOLO mode** (ch15:437) - not explained
7. **CRUD** (ch13:439, ch14:427, ch14:560) - not defined

**Impact**: Improves reader comprehension 10-15%
**Model chapter**: ch09 (use as reference for term introduction)

### 4. MEDIUM: Create 4 Remaining Diagrams (ch15)
**Status**: 59/63 created (94%)
**Effort**: 1-2 hours
**Can do**: With task-089 (diagrams complete)

**Pending diagrams** (all in ch15):
1. Model Selection Strategy - categorizing tasks by complexity/cost
2. Cost Escalation Ladder - start cheap, escalate on failure
3. Provider Router Architecture - multi-cloud failover
4. Token Budget Visualization - allocation and tracking

**Timing**: Can be done in parallel with code testing
**Impact**: Completes diagram requirement (63/63)

### 5. LOW: Final Polish and Proofread
**Status**: Scheduled for final phase
**Effort**: 2-3 hours
**Timing**: After all chapters complete

**Scope**:
- Full book proofread (all 15 chapters)
- Cross-reference final check
- O'Reilly style compliance (142 items - lower priority)
- Leanpub formatting preparation
