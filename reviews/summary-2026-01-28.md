## Quality Dashboard

| Check | Issues | Severity Breakdown | Trend |
|-------|--------|-------------------|-------|
| AI Slop | 51 | 1 critical, 45 high, 5 medium | stable |
| Tech Accuracy | 23 | 13 errors, 10 warnings | stable |
| Term Intros | 52 | 6 critical, 46 medium | stable |
| Cross-refs | 18 | 9 critical, 9 medium | stable |
| O'Reilly Style | 147 | 31 high, 72 medium, 44 low | stable |

**Total Quality Issues**: 291

**Quality Notes:**
- Chapters are clean for AI slop (most issues in PRDs)
- Chapter 2 has CLI syntax errors requiring systematic fixes
- Chapters 7 and 13 have hooks configuration errors
- 150+ C-level headings need sentence case conversion
- Ch11 references non-existent Chapter 15

---

## Top 5 Priority Actions

1. **Write remaining chapter drafts (ch14-ch15)** - 2 chapters remaining; ch14 Meta-Engineer Playbook and ch15 Model Strategy

2. **Fix Chapter 2 CLI syntax errors** - `claude ask`, `claude chat`, `claude init` commands don't exist; needs replacement with `claude -p` and `claude`

3. **Fix hooks documentation (ch07, ch13)** - Hook configuration is fundamentally incorrect; hooks use settings.json, not separate files

4. **Fix ch11 Chapter 15 reference** - Line 724 references non-existent chapter; remove or mark as upcoming

5. **Convert C-level headings to sentence case** - 150+ instances across all chapters for O'Reilly compliance

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. Write Chapter 14: The Meta-Engineer Playbook first draft
2. Update claude-progress.txt with session entry

### Short-Term (Next 2-3 Sessions)
1. Complete Chapter 15: Model Strategy & Cost Optimization
2. Fix ch11 line 724 reference to Chapter 15
3. Begin systematic CLI syntax fixes in ch02

### Medium-Term (Week 2)
1. Fix hooks documentation in ch07 and ch13
2. Create high-priority diagrams (14 total)
3. Run code validation on all chapters
4. Begin heading case batch fix

### Quality Debt Paydown Order
1. CLI errors (blocks user following along)
2. Hooks config (technical accuracy)
3. Cross-references (internal consistency)
4. Heading case (style compliance)
5. Term introductions (reader comprehension)
