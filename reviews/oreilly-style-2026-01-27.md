## Recommendations

1. **Batch fix C-level headings**: This is the most pervasive issue. Use find-and-replace to convert Title Case to sentence case for all ### headings. Be careful with proper nouns (Claude Code, CLAUDE.md).

2. **Add acronym glossary**: Consider adding an appendix with acronym definitions. Expand on first use in each chapter for readers who start mid-book.

3. **Standardize filename typography**: Create a style rule: filenames in prose are *italic*, filenames in code examples use `constant width`.

4. **Add table captions**: Every table needs a caption in format "Table X-Y. Description" placed above the table, with an in-text reference before the table appears.

5. **Review code block introductions**: Ensure all code blocks are introduced with a colon at the end of the preceding sentence.

6. **Number consistency pass**:
   - Spell out zero through nine
   - Use numerals for 10+
   - Add commas to numbers 1,000+
   - Use "or later" instead of "+" for versions

## Overall Assessment

The manuscript demonstrates strong adherence to O'Reilly's conversational tone guidelines. The writing is clear, technical content is well-explained, and code examples are plentiful and practical. The reader-centric approach ("you will learn", "your job is") aligns well with O'Reilly's style.

**Strengths:**
- Engaging opening paragraphs that hook readers
- Practical, real-world examples throughout
- Consistent second-person voice
- Excellent balance of concept explanation and code

**Areas for improvement:**
- C-level heading capitalization (sentence case required)
- Acronym expansion on first use per chapter
- Table formatting and captions
- Filename typography (italic vs code font)

The issues identified are largely mechanical and can be addressed efficiently in a copyedit pass. The content quality and pedagogical approach are excellent.
