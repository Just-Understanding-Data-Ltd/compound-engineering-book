## Priority Fixes

### High Priority (23 issues)
1. **Acronym expansion** (6 issues): DDD, OTEL, LLMs, DAG, TLA+, CI/CD need expansion on first use
2. **Table captions** (4 issues): All tables need captions and pre-references
3. **C-level heading case** (63+ issues): All ### headings should use sentence case

### Medium Priority (41 issues)
1. **Typography**: Filenames should be italic, not code font (8 issues)
2. **First-use italics**: Technical terms should be italicized on first use (4 issues)
3. **Code block introductions**: Add colons before code blocks (5 issues)
4. **List consistency**: Standardize period usage in lists (3 issues)

### Low Priority (25 issues)
1. **Time abbreviations**: Use space between number and unit
2. **Minor formatting**: Various small typography adjustments

---

## Recommendations

1. **Batch fix C-level headings**: This is the most pervasive issue. Use find-and-replace carefully to convert Title Case to sentence case for all ### headings.

2. **Add acronym glossary**: Consider adding an appendix with acronym definitions, and expand on first use in each chapter.

3. **Standardize filename typography**: Create a style rule: filenames in prose are *italic*, filenames in code examples use `constant width`.

4. **Add table captions**: Every table needs a caption in the format "Table X-Y. Description" placed before the table, with an in-text reference.

5. **Review code block introductions**: Ensure all code blocks are introduced with a colon at the end of the preceding sentence.
