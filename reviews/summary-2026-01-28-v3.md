3. **Fix ch02 CLI syntax errors** (8 commands don't exist)
   - `claude ask`, `claude chat`, `claude init` need replacement
   - Should use `claude -p` (plan mode) and `claude` (chat mode)
   - Severity: High (users cannot follow along)
   - Estimated effort: 1-2 hours

4. **Create high-priority diagrams** (14-20 initial diagrams)

## Code Testing Requirements

| Category | Required | Status | Notes |
|----------|----------|--------|-------|
| TypeScript Examples | 79 total | 0/79 tested | All chapters have examples |
| Compilation | 79 examples | 0 checked | Need `tsc --noEmit` pass |
| Agent SDK v2 Usage | ~30 examples | Not validated | Verify unstable_v2 APIs |

3. Test by chapter: Part I (ch01-ch03) first, then Part II-IV

- **Gate 3**: Mermaid template validated - **READY** (tested in reviews/)
- **Status**: GO - Start diagrams after KB completion

### Phase 4 Start Gate (Code Testing)
- **Gate 1**: exercise-validator tooling verified - **READY** (exists in repo)
- **Gate 2**: SDK v2 APIs documented - **READY** (CLAUDE.md has reference)
- **Gate 3**: Cache directory structure - **READY** (examples/.cache/ exists)
- **Status**: READY - Can start during/after diagram phase

### Phase 5 Start Gate (Review & Polish)

## Historical Progress

| Checkpoint | PRDs | Chapters | Words | KB Articles | Diagrams |
|------------|------|----------|-------|-------------|----------|
| 2026-01-27 (v1) | 12 | 7 | 18,651 | 0 | 0 |

**Observations**:
- Chapter writing velocity: ~3,000 words/session
- KB article creation: 14 articles in ~1 session (with other work)
- Quality debt: Stable at ~250-300 issues (normal for draft phase)

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| KB article creation stalls | Low | Blocks Phase 3 | 1 article ready, well-scoped |
| Code validation uncovers major issues | Medium | Requires 5-10 hour fixes | Can skip examples with skip-validation |
| Diagram creation bottleneck | Medium | Extends timeline 2-4 weeks | Pre-designed Mermaid templates ready |
| Cross-reference fixes incomplete | Low | Reader confusion | 3 known issues identified, trackable |
| CLI syntax changes break examples | Medium | Needs chapter updates | Verification agent can catch changes |

**Overall Risk Level**: Low - Path to completion clear, major blockers identified and addressed

---

## Success Criteria for Next Review (2026-01-29)

- [ ] KB article completion (prompt-injection-prevention.md)
- [ ] ch01 cross-reference fixes (3 links)
- [ ] ch02 CLI syntax initial pass (at least 4 commands fixed)
- [ ] High-priority diagrams: ch01-ch03 complete (5-7 diagrams)
