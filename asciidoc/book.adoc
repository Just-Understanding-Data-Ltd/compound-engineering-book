// Part I: Foundations
[part]
= Foundations

The first three chapters establish the mental models and foundational skills you need for AI-assisted development. You'll understand what compound engineering means, get hands-on with Claude Code, and master the fundamentals of effective prompting.

include::ch02-getting-started-with-claude-code.adoc[]

include::ch03-prompting-fundamentals.adoc[]

// Part II: Core Techniques
[part]
= Core Techniques

These three chapters cover the essential patterns you'll use daily. You'll learn to write effective CLAUDE.md files, build reliable agents using the 12-factor methodology, and implement verification ladders that catch errors before they compound.

include::ch06-the-verification-ladder.adoc[]

// Part III: Advanced Patterns
[part]
= Advanced Patterns

Advanced techniques for power users. You'll implement quality gates that compound over time, master error handling and debugging strategies, and deep dive into context engineering to maximize Claude's effectiveness.

include::ch09-context-engineering-deep-dive.adoc[]

// Part IV: Production Systems
[part]
= Production Systems

Building autonomous systems that work while you sleep. You'll implement the RALPH loop for long-running agents, design sub-agent architectures, master development workflows, build production harnesses, adopt the meta-engineer playbook, and optimize for cost and model selection.
