## Blockers & Notes

### Sub-Agent Analysis Summary (Jan 27, 2026)

**Coverage Statistics:**
- KB articles referenced: ~55/93 (59%)
- Unreferenced articles: 29 (30.5%)
- PRDs with complete KB coverage: 0/15

**Priority Improvements:**
1. Part III chapters (Advanced) need most work - missing entropy/reliability concepts
2. Ch09 (Sub-Agent) and Ch10 (Harness) have critical missing articles
3. New KB articles needed for orchestration patterns and actor-critic
4. Ch15 (Model Strategy) needs YOLO mode, Skills system, cost protection content

**TOC Restructuring Options (from sub-agent):**
- Option A (Minimal): Add missing KB refs to existing PRDs
- Option B (Moderate): Reorder some chapters for better flow
- Option C (Comprehensive): Split some chapters, merge others

**Current Recommendation:** Start with Option A (PRD enhancement), evaluate B/C after chapter drafts.
